# CryptoPunks

The CryptoPunks are 10,000 uniquely generated characters. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain.

CryptoPunks has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the CryptoPunks smart contracts.

This subgraph can be used to query on-chain CryptoPunks data. The subgraph data is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called [Indexers](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/network/indexing/).

The CryptoPunks subgraph works by listening for events emitted by one or more data sources (Smart Contracts) on the various chains. It handles the indexing and caching of data which can later be queried using the GraphQL API Endpoint, providing an excellent developer experience.
